.SYNOPSIS
    Setup script for Python project environment using uv, with preemptive deletion of `.venv`.

.DESCRIPTION
    Deletes `.venv` if it exists, installs 'uv' if missing, creates a new virtual environment, activates it,
    installs project dependencies, and provides user-friendly messages.
