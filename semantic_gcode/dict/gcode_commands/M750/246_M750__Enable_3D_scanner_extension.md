## M750: Enable 3D scanner extension

This code may be used as an OEM extension to enable scanner functionality in the firmware.

### Examples

M750

### Notes

After a regular start of RepRapFirmware, the 3D scan extension is disabled by default, but if additional scanner components are attached, this code may be used to enable certain OEM functions.
