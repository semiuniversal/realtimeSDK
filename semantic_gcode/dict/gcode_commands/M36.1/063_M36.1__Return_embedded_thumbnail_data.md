## M36.1: Return embedded thumbnail data

This command is used to return the data for a thumbnail image in a GCode file. The offset value should be either the offset of the start of data for a thumbnail as returned by the M36 command, or the value returned in the "next" field by a previous M36.1 command. The response is in JSON format.

### Parameters

- **P"filename"** Name of the GCode file from which thumbnail data is to be retrieved

- **Snnnn** Byte offset into the file at which thumbnail data is to be fetched

### Example

M36.1 P"/gcodes/EscherLizardModified.gcode" S103

Sample response:

{fileName":"EscherLizardModified.gcode","offset":103,"data":"cW9pZgAAACA....AAAAB","next":0,err": 0}

The "fileName" and "offset" values are as given in the command. "data" is part or all of the base64-encoded thumbnail data starting at that offset. "next" is zero if there is no more data for that thumbnail, otherwise not all the thumbnail data was returned and "next" is the byte offset in the file of the rest of the thumbnail data. "err" is 0 if the command was successful, otherwise "err" is nonzero and the other fields may or may not be present.
