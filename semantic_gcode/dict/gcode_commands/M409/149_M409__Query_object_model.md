## M409: Query object model

### Parameters

- **K"key"** Key string, default empty

- **F"flags"** Flags string, default empty

- **Rnnn** Pass through request to RepRapFirmware (only for SBC mode, v3.5.2 or later)

- **Innn** Increment sequence number of the given key (reserved for internal usage ONLY)

### Examples

M409 K"move.axes" F"f" ; report all frequently-changing properties of all axes M409 K"move.axes\[0\]" F"v,n,d4" ; report all properties of the first axis, including values not normally reported, to a maximum depth of 4 M409 K"move.axes\[\].homed" ; for all axes, report whether it is homed M409 K"#move.axes" ; report the number of axes M409 F"v" ; report the whole object model to the default depth

### Usage

The key string is just the path to the object model variables wanted, with the following extensions:

- An element that is an array may be followed by either \[number\] to select just one element, or by to select all elements and report the results as an array

- The path may be preceded by \# in which case the path must refer to an array and just the number of array elements is returned

An empty key string selects the entire object model. Note, the entire object model may be very large, so there is typically insufficient buffer space to construct a JSON response that represents the whole object model. For this reason, RepRapFirmware sets a default maximum depth of 1 if the key string is empty or not present and the 'f' flag is not included in the flags string.

The flags string may include one or more of the following letters:

- f: return only those values in the object model that typically change frequently during a job

- v: Verbose: include values that are rarely needed and not normally returned

- n: include fields with null values

- o: include obsolete fields (v3.3 and newer)

- d: limit the depth of the reported tree to the specified number following the letter 'd'. Objects at the maximum depth will be returned as {}.

- a: use this only when the key requested is an array, e.g. "tools" or "move.axes". When an array contains a lot of data, it may not be possible to return the entire array in one go. This parameter directs RRF to fetch array elements starting at the number that follows the letter 'a', default 0. The "next" field in the reply indicates the index of the first array element that was not fetched, or 0 if there are no more elements to fetch.

- p: this indicates that the requesting device is PanelDue or a similar device. It causes RRF not to return fields that are not of interest to PanelDue, thereby shortening the response. Supported in RRF 3.6.0 and later; ignored by earlier RRF versions.

The flags string may optionally use spaces or commas to separate the individual flags

The response is a JSON object of the following form: {"key":"key","flag'":"flags","result":object-value}

If the key string is malformed or refers to a property that does not exist in the object model, the result field is **null**.

### Notes

- For details of the Object Model supported by RepRapFirmware, see \>Object Model of RepRapFirmware.

- From RRF 3.6.0 some floating point values in the object model returned by M409 are now expressed using exponential format.

- As of RRF 3.5.0 some arrays in the M409 response may be truncated under some conditions, to ensure that the response will fit in the available buffer space. Currently the only array affected is move.axes\[\] which is truncated to 9 elements unless the 'f' flag is included. To retrieve the entire array, make a request for key "move.axes" with flag "a0".

- SBC note: When keys are queried that are provided by DSF, potential flags are ignored.
