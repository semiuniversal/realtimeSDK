## M569.9: Configure driver sense resistor and maximum current

Supported by the STM port of RRF only

### Parameters

- **Pn.n** Motor CAN board address (if applicable) and driver number

- **Rnnnn** Driver current sense resistor value in ohms

- **Snnnn** Driver maximum current limit in amperes

### Examples

M569.9 P0.1 R0.075 S4.4 ; driver 1 on the main board has a 0.075 Ohm sense resistor and will have the maximum current setting limited to 4.4A

### Notes

This command is available on boards running the STM32 port of RepRapFirmware (version 3.4.2_102 and later), it can be used to inform the firmware of the TMC driver sense resistor and maximum current limit used by driver modules that have non standard values.
