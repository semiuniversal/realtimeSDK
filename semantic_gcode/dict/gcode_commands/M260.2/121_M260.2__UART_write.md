## M260.2: UART write

Supported from firmware version 3.6

Write data to a generic UART device.

### Parameters

- **Pnn** Serial port to send/receive through, numbered as in M575 (1 = first aux port, 2 = second aux port). The port must already have been set to Device mode using M575.

- **Bnn:nn:nn...** Array of data to send to the UART. Each element is 1 byte, if a value is greater than 0xFF (255) then it will be truncated to the lowest byte.

- **S"ascii data"** data to send (alternative to B parameter). Each character is converted to the corresponding ASCII value. Ignored if **B** parameter is present.

### Order dependency

The port used by the P parameter must already have been set to Device mode using M575.

### Examples

M260.2 P1 B20 ; write 20 to register 10 of the device at address 5 M260.2 P1 B72:101:108:108:111:32:119:111:114:108:100 ; write "Hello world" (when converted to ascii) M260.2 P1 B{0x02, 0x30, 0x03} ; writing data as hex M260.2 P1 B{0xFF01, 257} ; write 0x01:0x01 to UART as data is truncated to 1 byte M260.2 P1 S"Hello world" ; write "Hello world" to UART
