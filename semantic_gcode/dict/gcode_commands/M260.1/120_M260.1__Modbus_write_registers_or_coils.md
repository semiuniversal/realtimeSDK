## M260.1: Modbus write registers or coils

Supported from firmware version 3.6

Write data to a Modbus slave device using standard Modbus protocol. If the device you wish to commuicatre with does not use the standard Modbus-RTU command set then you may be able to communicate with it using M260.4 instead.

### Parameters

- **Pnn** Serial port to send/receive through, numbered as in M575 (1 = first aux port, 2 = second aux port). The port must already have been set to Device mode using M575.

- **Ann** Modbus slave device address

- **Fn** (optional) Modbus function code, must be one of: 5 (Write Single Coil), 6 (Write Single Register), 15 (Write Multiple Coils), 16 (Write Multiple Registers, default)

- **Rnn** First Modbus coil or register number to write to

- **Bnn:nn:nn...** One value per coil or register to write. If writing registers, each value is a 16-bit word to write. If writing coils, each value is zero to set coil off, nonzero to set coil on.

- **S"ascii data"** data to send (alternative to B parameter). Each character is converted to the corresponding ASCII value. Ignored if **B** parameter is present.

### Order dependency

The port used by the P parameter must already have been set to Device mode using M575.

### Examples

M260.1 P1 A5 R10 B956 ; write 956 to register 10 of the device at address 5 M260.1 P1 A8 R20 B123:456 ; write 123 to register 20 and 456 to register 21 of the device at address 8
