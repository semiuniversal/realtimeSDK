## M918: Configure direct-connect display

This command is used to tell RepRapFirmware about a directly-connected LCD such as a 12864 or compatible display.

### Parameters

- **Pn** Directly-connected display type: P1 = 128x64 pixel mono graphics display using ST7920 display driver, P2 = 128x64 display using ST7567 display driver (RRF 3.02 and later), P3 = 480x320 TFT display with resistive touch panel using ILI9488 driver (RRF 3.5 and later only).

- **En** (optional, defaults to 1) The number of pulses generated by the rotary encoder per detent. Typical values are 2 and 4. Negative values (e.g. -2 and -4) reverse the encoder direction.

- **F** (optional, supported in RRF 2.03 and later) SPI clock frequency in Hz, default 2000000 (i.e. 2MHz). The maximum usable value with short cables is around 4MHz for 12864 displays and 15MHz for TFT displays.

- **C** (optional, supported in RRF 3.2 and later) Display contrast, in range 0 to 100. Only used with ST7567-based displays. ST7920-based displays usually have a contrast potentiometer instead.

- **R** (optional, supported in RRF 3.2 and later) Display resistor ratio, in range 1 to 7. Only used with ST7567-based displays. The default value of 6 is suitable for the Fysetc Mini 12864 display. Some other displays need 3.

### Examples

M918 P1 E2

### Notes

See Connecting 12864 or other display for supported Duet boards and usage.
