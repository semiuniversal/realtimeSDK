## M73: Set remaining print time

### Parameters

- **Pnn** Percentage of the print that has been completed (not used by RRF)

- **Rnn** Remaining print time in minutes

- **Cnn** Time until user interacton is required, in minutes (supported by RRF 3.6.0 and later)

M73 is generated by some slicers, to inform the firmware about the state of the print so that it can provide a better estimate of the remaining print time.
