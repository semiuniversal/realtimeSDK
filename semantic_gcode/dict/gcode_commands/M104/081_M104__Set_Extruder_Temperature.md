## M104: Set Extruder Temperature

### Parameters

- **Snnn** target temperature

- **Tn** optional tool number

### Examples

M104 S190 M104 S220 T1

The first example sets the active and standby temperature of the current tool to 190oC and return control to the host immediately (i.e. before that temperature has been reached by the extruder). If no tool is active, it will apply to the lowest non-negative tool number.

The second example sets the active and standby temperatures of tool 1 to 220oC. If tool 1 is off, it will be set to standby as well (resulting in tool 1 heating up to the temperature given).

See also M109.

This command is deprecated in RRF for multi-tool machines because the G10/M568 commands provide more control, for example separate active and standby temperatures. However, it is widely generated by slicers so RRF will continue to support it.
