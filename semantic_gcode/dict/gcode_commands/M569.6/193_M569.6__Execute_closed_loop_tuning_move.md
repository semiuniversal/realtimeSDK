## M569.6: Execute closed loop tuning move

Perform a runtime tuning manoeuvre with a closed loop drive.

### Parameters

- **Pnn** Motor driver number

- **Vnn** Tuning move to perform

### Description

**Warning: Duet firmware currently only supports tuning one driver at a time. This means that when tuning a multi-driver axis, one driver will move and the other(s) will not. If attempting to tune a multi-driver axis, please take appropriate mitigation to ensure the axis doesn't become stressed/misaligned when only one one driver moves.**

The closed-loop tuning page lists the available tuning moves.

### Examples

M569.6 P50.0 V1 ; conduct polarity detection and zeroing move on closed loop driver on HCL board at address 50. M569.6 P51.0 V2 ; conduct magnetic encoder calibration on move on closed loop driver on HCL board with magnetic encoder at address 50.

### Notes

Supported for drivers attached to:

- Duet 3 Expansion 1HCL boards
