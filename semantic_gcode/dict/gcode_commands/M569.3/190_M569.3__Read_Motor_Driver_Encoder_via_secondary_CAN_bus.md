## M569.3: Read Motor Driver Encoder via secondary CAN bus

Supported on Duet 3 MB6HC and MB6XD boards with ODrives connected to the second CAN bus and Hangprinter kinematics configured

Report a current motor encoder positions to the host in units of arc degrees (1/360'ths of turns), relative to some reference position that you set with the **S** parameter.

### Parameters

- **Pnn** Motor driver number, or board address and driver number. Several (remote) drivers may be specified, separated by colon. No more than number of visible axes, as specified by M584 P parameter, are allowed.

- **S** Sets an encoder reference point. Current and subsequent M569.3 Pn.n calls returns numbers that are relative to the M569.3 Pn.n S call.

### Examples

M569.3 Error: M569: missing parameter 'P' M569.3 P54.0 Error: M569.3: Message not received M569.3 P50.0:51.0:52.0:53.0 \[-155.28, -4089.60, 6842.04, 0.00, \], M569.3 P53.0:51.0:52.0:50.0 \[0.00, -4089.60, 6842.04, -155.28, \], M569.3 P53.0:51.0:52.0:50.0 S \[0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, \], M569.3 P49.0 Error: M569.3: Max CAN addresses we can reference is 4. Can't reference board 49.

### Notes

Before the first call with the **S** parameter, the reference is unknown and arbitrary.

If **P** is not supplied, an error is returned.

A maximum of four CAN-connected drivers can be reached with M569.3 counting from machine boot. CAN addresses that fail to respond don't count towards this maximum.
