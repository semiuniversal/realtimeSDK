## M751: Register 3D scanner extension over USB

When a 3D scanner board is attached to the USB port, this code is used to turn on communication between the 3D printing and the scanner board.

### Examples

M751

### Notes

If the USB connection is removed while the 3D scanner configuration is active, the firmware will disable it again and restore the default communication parameters.
